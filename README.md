# NoSleep

A lightweight macOS menu bar utility that prevents your Mac from sleeping. Wraps the built-in `caffeinate` command into a simple, toggleable status bar app.

No Dock icon. No main window. Just a cup icon in your menu bar.

## Features

- **One-click toggle** — start/stop caffeinate from the menu bar
- **Duration presets** — 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 10 hr, or Indefinite
- **Live countdown** — shows remaining time while active
- **Start at Login** — optional LaunchAgent for auto-start
- **Prevents display + idle sleep** — uses `caffeinate -d -i`

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- Swift 6.0+

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Compile the project with `swift build -c release`
2. Create `NoSleep.app` bundle with `Info.plist`
3. Ad-hoc code sign the app

## Run

```bash
open NoSleep.app
```

A cup icon (☕) appears in your menu bar. Click it to see the menu:

- **Start/Stop** — toggle caffeinate on or off
- **Duration** — pick how long to keep your Mac awake
- **Start at Login** — enable to launch NoSleep automatically on boot
- **Quit** — stop caffeinate and exit the app

The icon changes to a filled cup when active.

## Install to ~/Applications (optional)

```bash
./install.sh
```

Copies `NoSleep.app` to `~/Applications/` and updates the LaunchAgent path if Start at Login is enabled.

## Uninstall

```bash
# Remove the app
rm -rf ~/Applications/NoSleep.app

# Remove the LaunchAgent (if enabled)
rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nosleep.app.plist

# Remove saved preferences
defaults delete com.nosleep.app 2>/dev/null
```

## How It Works

NoSleep spawns `/usr/bin/caffeinate` as a child process with flags:
- `-d` — prevent the display from sleeping
- `-i` — prevent the system from idle sleeping
- `-t <seconds>` — auto-stop after the selected duration (omitted for Indefinite)

When you quit NoSleep or click Stop, the caffeinate process is terminated. If caffeinate's timer expires naturally, the app detects this and updates its state.
